# Whisky

Whisky is a fantastic beverage. But it's also a tiny webframework (at least it
will be). It currently doesn't do much, but I'm putting this project together
as an exercise to get a better understanding of how to build something with
Rack.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'whisky'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install whisky
